  <div class="entry-content"><p>At the end of last week, we discussed inheritance and modules.  I needed to go over it again as not all of it sunk in during lecture-runtime.  So here goes:</p>

<p>If classes save us from being redunant by making certain methods available to all instances of that class, then inheritance seems to build on that notion of &ldquo;sharing&rdquo; in that it allow a Class to make its capabilities available to a sub-class(es) which can then include further specificity and additional methods.</p>

<p>When I looked it up, many used taxonomies to [explain] (<a href="http://www.rubist.net/~slagell/ruby/inheritance.html">http://www.rubist.net/~slagell/ruby/inheritance.html</a>).</p>

<p>So instead of mammals and fish, lets use plants.  The plant kingdom has characteristics that are true for all things defined as plants including properties like they are cellular, convert energy from sunlight to food, can propogate etc.</p>

<p>There are two primary subclasses of plants: seed-bearing and spore-bearing. Both subclasses possess plant kingdom characteristics (cellular, absorb sunlight) but also possess additional specifics such as being able to have flowers, being able to either absorb water or circulate fluids throughout itself or be of a certain sex or be asexual.</p>

<p>So in Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>class Plant
end

class Rose &lt;Plant
end

class Algae &lt; Plant
end
</code></pre>

<p>The Rose class and Algae class are &ldquo;Child&rdquo; classes that inherit (denoted by &lt;) all characteristics of the &ldquo;Parent&rdquo; class Plant. But they have further specificity:</p>

<pre><code>class Plant
    def live
        puts "multicellular, can reproduce, absorbs light, circulate or absorb water"
    end
end

class Rose &lt;Plant
    def make_flower
        puts "leaf, stem, roots" 
    end
end


class Moss &lt; Plant
    def produce_spore
        puts "simple, can live on another plant"
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>A Rose and Moss are a type of plant but also have their own specialized things they can do.  Its important to note that a Class can only inherit features from one other class.</p>

<p>This brings us to Modules and Mixins.  Modules are, according to Ruby docs [ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Module.html], a collection of methods and constants.  They are another way that functionality can be &ldquo;shared&rdquo; between classes. I liked the following description[ruby.about.com/od/beginningruby/a/mixin.htm]</p>

<p>It says that mixins are a group of methods not yet attached to any class.  They exist in a module and are not useful until included in a class.  Once included they are now normal methods of a class.</p>

<p>So illustrating on the above Class inheritance structure:</p>

<p>module Plant</p>

<pre><code>def live
    puts "multicellular, can reproduce, absorbs light, circulate or absorb water"
end
</code></pre>

<p>end</p>

<pre><code>class Rose &lt;Plant
    include Plant

    def make_flower
        puts "leaf, stem, roots" 
    end
end


class Moss &lt; Plant
    include Plant

    def produce_spore
        puts "simple, can live on another plant"
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Methods within a module can either be ins tance methods or module methods.  In the example above, the module is included (via &ldquo;include&rdquo;) in within a class, thus the module&rsquo;s methods are &ldquo;mixed in&rdquo; as instance methods and apply to all instances of the Rose and Moss classes.</p>

<p>Why is this better?</p>

<p>This person explains it nicely [dycktypo.blogspot.com/2010/08/why-inheritance-sucks.html]</p>

<pre><code>Modules are generally more flexible than superclasses.  Modules can be managed at runtime, because include is just  regular method call, while superclasses are set in stone as you write your class definitions.  Modules are much easier to use and test in isolation than tightly coupled hierachy of classes.   You can include as many modules as you like, while you can only have one superclass per class. 
</code></pre>

<p>Modules can also be applied at the Class level by adding &ldquo;extend Plant&rdquo; within the Moss and Rose Classes.  This would allows the module</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is a journey of a housewife learning to code.  Over the years, I&rsquo;ve become quite a creative chef trying to feed two very picky eaters.  Pureed cauliflower in mac-in-cheese, dates and quinoa in banana bread, and beets in raspberry sorbet.  I thought code would be sort of like cooking.  Start with a recipe, add a pinch of this and a little dash of that, and voila.   Er uh, not really.  Over the past few weeks, there are days where I feel as though I&rsquo;ve been dropped in the middle Iron Chef-Japan and I don&rsquo;t speak the language.  What? Theme ingredient is sea urchin and the course is dessert?  Hmmmmm.</p>

<p>Almost two weeks ago we started with Git.  Very cool to clone and push.  Although I am still afraid of Master.  Took time, but &lsquo;fork&rsquo; now has new meaning to me.  As do &lsquo;.slice,&rsquo; &lsquo;.split,&rsquo; &lsquo;.push,&rsquo; &lsquo;.pop&rsquo; and &lsquo;scrape&rsquo; after last week&rsquo;s Ruby binge.  Writing those words can make anyone feel like this week&rsquo;s I.C. Master Hiroyuki Sakai.</p>

<p>This week we&rsquo;re starting to blog.  For years, I purposefully put off forming accounts for Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter for fear that I would lose myself in a vortex of connecting with childhood friends vs. connecting with my own children.  Plus, what did I have to say out there on the fringes of the web?  Its a big step to be blogging.  About code nonetheless.</p>

<p>Will get to Ruby in the next blog, but for now, lets talk about the matter at hand: Git&rsquo;s Octopress.  I was just trying to get a sense of the various blog engines out there and stumbled on this brief overview which lists Octopress&rsquo;s pros.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.tealdi.com.br/2013/07/11/why-ive-chosen-octopress">http://blog.tealdi.com.br/2013/07/11/why-ive-chosen-octopress</a></p>

<p>Tealdi sums it up nicely:
&ldquo;Octopress is a simple framework designed for Jekyll, that is powering GitHub Pages. Jekyll is a simple, lightweight static site generator written in Ruby. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server.&rdquo;  Wow, clear even to the foreigner!</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a neat little presentation speakerdeck.com called &ldquo;Octopress: A blogging framework for hackers&rdquo; by Akira Maeda. A propos.  A little sad but while others are probably blogging about scraping websites with Nokogiri, I&rsquo;m blogging about how to blog.  Baby steps.</p>

<p>Within the Presentation, very simple guideposts:
&ndash; Write Markdown
&ndash; Generate
&ndash; Deploy <em>I love this word and use it to launch my children off to school</em></p>

<h2>Octopress: A blogging framework for hackers</h2>

<p><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/glidenote/octopress">https://speakerdeck.com/glidenote/octopress</a></p>

<p>There are even 3rd Party Octopress Themes.  I&rsquo;m going to try one out now called &lsquo;Whitespace&rsquo; by Lucas Lew.  I&rsquo;m still figuring out how to customize the markdown.  I&rsquo;m getting closer&hellip;. This link tells you where to go to customize other attributes in the header, aside etc., but i have a little more work to do.</p>

<p><a href="http://octopress.org/docs/theme/template/">http://octopress.org/docs/theme/template/</a></p>

<p>Octopress utilizes the &ldquo;usual&rdquo; Git commands to commit your source code to the blog (git add/commit/push).  I feel like I&rsquo;m getting &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; practice on Git while I learn about blogging.</p>

<p>I bid you good eating.  Next up, Ruby with guest appearance from I.C. octopodafeline.</p>
