		<p>At the end of last week, we discussed inheritance and modules.  I needed to review it as not all of it had sunk-in at runtime-lecture.  So here goes:</p>

<p>If one of the many purposes of Ruby Classes is to help free us from redunancy by making certain methods available to all instances of that class.  Along that line it seems inheritance builds on the notion of &ldquo;sharing&rdquo; in that it allows a Class to make its capabilities available to sub-classes and include further specificity and/or additional methods where necessary.</p>

<p>As I researched inheritance up, people liked using taxonomies to help illustrate <a href="http://www.rubist.net/~slagell/ruby/inheritance.html">this</a>. I&rsquo;ll do the same but instead use plants instead of animals/mammals/etc.  The plant kingdom has certain characteristics that hold true for all things defined as plants including such attributes as&mdash; they are cellular, they can convert energy from sunlight to food, they can propogate etc.</p>

<p>There are two primary subclasses of plants: seed-bearing and spore-bearing. Both subclasses possess the primary plant kingdom characteristics (cellular, absorb sunlight) but they also possess additional specifics such as being able to have flowers, being able to either absorb water or circulate fluids throughout itself or being of a certain sex or asexual.</p>

<p>So in Ruby:</p>

<pre><code>class Plant
end

class Rose &lt;Plant
end

class Algae &lt; Plant
end
</code></pre>

<p>The Rose class and Algae class are &ldquo;Child&rdquo; classes that inherit (denoted by <code>&lt;</code>) all characteristics of the &ldquo;Parent&rdquo; class Plant. This makes it easy to ascribe further specificity:</p>

<pre><code>class Plant
    def live
        puts "multicellular, can reproduce, absorbs light, circulate or absorb water"
    end
end

class Rose &lt;Plant
    def make_flower
        puts "leaf, stem, roots" 
    end
end


class Moss &lt; Plant
    def produce_spore
        puts "simple, can live on another plant"
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>A Rose and Moss are a type of plant but also have their own specialized things they can do.  Its important to note that in Ruby, at least, a Class can only inherit features from <strong>one</strong> other class.</p>

<p>This brings us to Modules and Mixins.  Modules are, according to <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Module.html">Ruby docs</a>, a collection of methods and constants.  Hmmm. Need more help here. As it turns out, Ruby itself possesses a number of modules in its standard library.  A quick example in IRB:</p>

<pre><code>irb&gt; Math.sqrt(2)
=&gt;1.41421
irb&gt; Math::PI
=&gt;3.14159   
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>::</code> operator denotes which module Ruby should use for the value of a constant. If we want to refer to the methods or constants of a module directly without using <code>::</code>, we can <code>include</code> that module:</p>

<pre><code>irb&gt; include Math   
=&gt;Object
irb&gt; sqrt(2)
=&gt;1.41421
irb&gt; PI
=&gt;3.14159
</code></pre>

<p>As mentioned in the Pickaxe, &ldquo;Modules define a namespace, a sandbox in which your methods and constants can play without having to worry about being stepped on by other methods and constants.&rdquo; This is one important use of modules.</p>

<p>The other key important use of modules is that, like inheritance, modules allow functionality can be &ldquo;shared&rdquo; between classes thereby streamlining the number of times you have to write the same methods. As one person describes,</p>

<p>&ldquo;mixins are a group of methods not yet attached to any class.  They exist in a module and are not useful until included in a class.  Once included they are now normal methods of a class.&rdquo; (<a href="http://ruby.about.com/od/beginningruby/a/mixin.htm">source</a>)</p>

<p>So illustrating on the above Class inheritance structure:</p>

<pre><code>module Plant
    def live
        puts "multicellular, can reproduce, absorbs light, circulate or absorb water"
    end
end

class Rose &lt;Plant
    include Plant

    def make_flower
        puts "leaf, stem, roots" 
    end
end


class Moss &lt; Plant
    include Plant

    def produce_spore
        puts "simple, can live on another plant"
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Methods within a module can either be instance methods or module level methods.  In the example above, the module is included within a class, thus the module&rsquo;s methods are &ldquo;mixed in&rdquo; as instance methods and apply to all instances of the Rose and Moss classes. As</p>

<p>Why may modules be a better choice over classes with inheritance?</p>

<p>As <a href="http://ducktypo.blogspot.com/2010/08/why-inheritance-sucks.html">this person</a>  states: Modules are generally more flexible than superclasses.  Modules can be managed at runtime, because include is just  regular method call, while superclasses are set in stone as you write your class definitions.  Modules are much easier to use and test in isolation than tightly coupled hierachy of classes.   You can include as many modules as you like, while you can only have one superclass per class.</p>

<p>Modules can also be applied at the Class level by &ldquo;extending&rdquo; within the Class.  This would allows the methods within the module to be accessed by other classes.  This piece of Avi code from Friday&rsquo;s Playlister was what had led me to look into inheritance, modules and mixins a little further to begin with:</p>

<p><dt>memorable.rb</dt></p>

<pre><code>module Memorable
  module InstanceMethods
    def initialize
      self.class.all &lt;&lt; self
    end
  end

  module ClassMethods
    def self.extended(base)
      base.reset_all
    end

      def reset_all
      @all = [] #still do not quite understand why we don't use @@all here
    end

      def count
      self.all.size
    end

    def all
      @all
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>We see in the partial Artist.rb file below, all the methods in module Findable and ClassMethods specifically in Memorable will be Artist Class methods.  I also noted the use of <code>super</code>, whereby Ruby searches upward in the ancestry to find the method <code>initialize</code> so that it doesn&rsquo;t need to be written here again.</p>

<p><dt>artist.rb</dt></p>

<pre><code>class Artist
  attr_accessor :name
  attr_reader :songs

  extend Memorable::ClassMethods
  include Memorable::InstanceMethods #modules

  extend Findable

  def initialize
    super
    @songs = []
  end
[code omitted]
</code></pre>

<p>This serves as a start in learning about something unique and powerful to Ruby.  From the readings it seems that  other languages handle inheritance very differently (multiple inheritances etc.,).  Furthermore, really cool things happen when we start looking at how, for instance, mixins from Ruby&rsquo;s standard library (eg., <code>include</code>-ing Enumerable or Comparable is very cool) can work with code in the class using it. Looking forward to putting some of this into greater practice going forward.</p>

		<p>This is a journey of a housewife learning to code.  Over the years, I&rsquo;ve become quite a creative chef trying to feed two very picky eaters.  Pureed cauliflower in mac-in-cheese, dates and quinoa in banana bread, and beets in raspberry sorbet.  I thought code would be sort of like cooking.  Start with a recipe, add a pinch of this and a little dash of that, and voila.   Er uh, not really.  Over the past few weeks, there are days where I feel as though I&rsquo;ve been dropped in the middle Iron Chef-Japan and I don&rsquo;t speak the language.  What? Theme ingredient is sea urchin and the course is dessert?  Hmmmmm.</p>

<p>Almost two weeks ago we started with Git.  Very cool to clone and push.  Although I am still afraid of Master.  Took time, but &lsquo;fork&rsquo; now has new meaning to me.  As do &lsquo;.slice,&rsquo; &lsquo;.split,&rsquo; &lsquo;.push,&rsquo; &lsquo;.pop&rsquo; and &lsquo;scrape&rsquo; after last week&rsquo;s Ruby binge.  Writing those words can make anyone feel like this week&rsquo;s I.C. Master Hiroyuki Sakai.</p>

<p>This week we&rsquo;re starting to blog.  For years, I purposefully put off forming accounts for Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter for fear that I would lose myself in a vortex of connecting with childhood friends vs. connecting with my own children.  Plus, what did I have to say out there on the fringes of the web?  Its a big step to be blogging.  About code nonetheless.</p>

<p>Will get to Ruby in the next blog, but for now, lets talk about the matter at hand: Git&rsquo;s Octopress.  I was just trying to get a sense of the various blog engines out there and stumbled on this brief overview which lists Octopress&rsquo;s pros.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.tealdi.com.br/2013/07/11/why-ive-chosen-octopress">http://blog.tealdi.com.br/2013/07/11/why-ive-chosen-octopress</a></p>

<p>Tealdi sums it up nicely:
&ldquo;Octopress is a simple framework designed for Jekyll, that is powering GitHub Pages. Jekyll is a simple, lightweight static site generator written in Ruby. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server.&rdquo;  Wow, clear even to the foreigner!</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a neat little presentation speakerdeck.com called &ldquo;Octopress: A blogging framework for hackers&rdquo; by Akira Maeda. A propos.  A little sad but while others are probably blogging about scraping websites with Nokogiri, I&rsquo;m blogging about how to blog.  Baby steps.</p>

<p>Within the Presentation, very simple guideposts:
&ndash; Write Markdown
&ndash; Generate
&ndash; Deploy <em>I love this word and use it to launch my children off to school</em></p>

<h2>Octopress: A blogging framework for hackers</h2>

<p><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/glidenote/octopress">https://speakerdeck.com/glidenote/octopress</a></p>

<p>There are even 3rd Party Octopress Themes.  I&rsquo;m going to try one out now called &lsquo;Whitespace&rsquo; by Lucas Lew.  I&rsquo;m still figuring out how to customize the markdown.  I&rsquo;m getting closer&hellip;. This link tells you where to go to customize other attributes in the header, aside etc., but i have a little more work to do.</p>

<p><a href="http://octopress.org/docs/theme/template/">http://octopress.org/docs/theme/template/</a></p>

<p>Octopress utilizes the &ldquo;usual&rdquo; Git commands to commit your source code to the blog (git add/commit/push).  I feel like I&rsquo;m getting &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; practice on Git while I learn about blogging.</p>

<p>I bid you good eating.  Next up, Ruby with guest appearance from I.C. octopodafeline.</p>
